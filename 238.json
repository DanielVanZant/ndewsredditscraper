Any combination is safe in low enough doses.\n\nLike the Paracelsus quote: \"It is the dose that makes a thing poison.\"\n\nThat said, due to the high degree of variability regarding individual physiology, purity of substance, tolerance, etc, the line between safe and unsafe is nebulous. As a general rule of thumb, opioids and benzos are dangerous in combination.\n\nWhen combined together they cause CNS/respiratory depression, responsive to the dose. It is possible to safely combine the two, but again, its dose-dependent. From a recreational standpoint, I've known a lot of people who enjoyed mixing the two classes.\n\nOf those people, two are dead from overdose, one from heart disease from IV use, another from sepsis infection from IV use. I've also known people who survive and regularly combine opioids/benzos. If your intent on combining the two, don't push it.\n\nIIRC, AP-238 does not have remarkable respiratory depression relative to other opioids. But the real risk is in Benzo's tendency to inhibit judgement. People will get reckless, make stupid decisions, etc. I think most overdoses come from this, as responsible use of the two substances is not remarkably dangerous.",

The more reports there are the easier it is to really find info on these compounds, and knowing the withdrawals after varying degrees/duration of use is helpful. It really does seem that 2map is a caustic full agonist with a short duration of effects but relatively long half life (with many reports of withdrawals not showing up for longer than expected), while AP-238 is a partial agonist that is still caustic and has slightly longer effects with substantially less rush. \n\nWith a combination of Kratom and very low dose benzos (or phenibut) you should be able to get through the withdrawals fairly painlessly. With the Kratom acting at the different opioid receptors to make you not feel as miserable, low dose benzo or low dose phenibut reducing the anxiety/flood of norepinepherine, and if you get really bad GI issues something like Loperamide could likely keep you from experiencing any serious withdrawal issues whatsoever. May take a little bit longer than just completely jumping off (since you would have to slightly taper those as well), but it's entirely possible you could be all tapered off and good to go within 2 weeks.

From insufflation people are mentioning there's no burn, but has anyone checked for tissue damage in the nose or tried putting a small amount on the tongue to see what happens? For AP238 it sounded like some people had no burn from insufflation, and others noted an insanely painful burn, but for both they reported nose bleeds/stuffed up nose/tissue damage regardless. \n\nThe thing that is unfortunate about RC's is the lack of transparency in the manufacturing process, or even ability to understand why certain properties exist, particularly in such a novel chem like the AP series. Was the original crystalline batch the most pure, and the chem itself was caustic? For this (reported so far) less caustic batch did they use some sort of solvents/impurities that slightly reduced the potency, but managed to either reduce the pain or tissue damaging properties? AP 238 seemed to be the same in properties for every batch people reported, yet different reports on causticity (at least for 2map there has been the crystalline batches that smelled of gasoline, cheese, and now this new one).\n\nThanks for posting such a detailed breakdown as well as images so people can compare to what they've had.",

Definitely not as strong as the crystal batch, but much easier on the nose, although that's not the route I use.

        "body": "There’s going to be a string of these but I hope I can add to this with my own take and it may help you decide if you are considering purchasing 2map in the future. \n\nFirst things first: **Is it AP 238?** My opinion is no. It does not strike me as AP 238 in effects or even consistency. It may look more like AP 238 than 2map, but it does not have a flowery feel to it. Where I felt like so could smash AP 238 into a flat powder, this substance is a bit harder to break up and get into a nice line. I’d even say that some of the clumps are hard and not softly packed.\n\nNow, let’s address the biggest drawback of both chemicals in their infancy, **the causticity.** This substance, from my initial testing, is not even remotely as caustic. It does not burn, but it’s taste is what I can only define as cleaning solution. A type of solvent? \n\n**The quality**, or in other terms strength, is less than the first batch. There is still a rush, it still has more euphoria than 238. I hate putting numbers to these things, especially ones that are entirely subjective and unscientific. That said, my feeling is that it is 70-80% as strong as the initial batch. I think saying it is half as good is being unfair, but again, these things are subject. \n\nI’ll end with **conjecture**: the product we see and get is the result of a Chinese lab. Period. I may have contributed to wondering if certain vendors were doing certain things to the chemicals. I apologize and retract any role in that. My guess is that the lab was doing something to improve on the original, may it be make it less caustic or less expensive to manufacture. At the end of the day, the domestic suppliers are being sent this product and it as already caused some of us to scratch our heads. Unless other evidence comes to light, I fully subscribe to the theory that the lab/creator playing around, followed a different script and now we have Parmesan 2map.\n\nStay safe guys. Anything I can do to help this community, I will.\n\nEdit: the more I think about it, the euphoria is considerably less.",

You'll be breathing thru your mouth for a while.\n\n***Edit:*** I've used a good bit of both 2map and ap238... If you're consistently snorting (or even boofing) this stuff please take a few days off here and there and just go with taking it orally. Your sinuses will thank you, believe me. \nBest way I've found for dosing both 2map & 238 orally is to chew up a couple tums or a similar rapid acting antacid 10-15min ideally or even at the same time. It seems to help neutralize some of that acidity/lower the Ph quite a bit. I just toss and wash it like Kratom cause capsules take too long and are a pain in the ass and parachuting always ends up with a joint paper stuck to my throat. Also Keep the afrin/plain saline nasal spray on deck for this one. A spray or two a Few minutes before & few minutes after snorting seems to reduce the negative physical effects on the ole nose pipes at least *somewhat.*  Enjoy the stuff all you want, but also keep the possible negatives in mind. This type of damage can't be \"undone\"...\n\nSorry for the rambling long ass comment lol. The 238/tapentadol/soma/lyrica combo i downed a half hr ago is starting to kick.

As for AP.238, if jt is the chunky, clumpy batch (the main one going around), after i did my caustic test with that batch, it failed miserably so i won't even touch that batch. If it is the fine, white crystalline  version/batch, it usually always passes my caustic powder test. i could sit and melt that batch all day longgg (for harm reduction purposes=not ALL day long lol) \n\nalso with the AP.238, i am starting to agree with the reports that it is a partial agonist like bupe. i def find myself hitting a ceiling with it and unless ur IV'ing it which...just no, not even close to an option for me....it is hard to get any kind of rush similar to that of which 2map (a full agonist) gives...AP.238 is most definitely phenomenal for actual pain/analgesia, duration and consistency (if your getting it from the right places...\n\nthats all of my 2 cents on both RC's...",

Honestly, it compares more favorably to kratom to a long time user but much more potent and heavy/sedating. I say that because it likely has a ceiling effect like kratom and lacks a rush and euphoria, like kratom does once you’ve used it more than a few times. 2map compares more to oxycodone because it does have a rush, but the key differences are it’s caustic nature and lack of duration.

I'm hoping by only dosing the rats 100mg or less of AP 238, their tolerance is dropping in the process, at least one can only hope.  \n\nThe Etazene is on its way, my rats are ready for a longer acting, more euphoric substance.  They tell me this may be the end of the fun for 2MAP237 once the Etazene is finished being tested.  We shall see...  May be a great tapering agent for them, so I will keep it around to keep WD's for my little guys as gentle as possible.",

This chem shouldn't be causing false positive tests for Fent under any circumstance... Keep in mind the same 'labs' who are synth'ing the 238 are probably also whipping up other Chems such as Fent/fentalogs/god knows what else. So cross contamination can be a real issue... Especially with Fent or an even stronger fentalog all you'd need is a couple 'misplaced' specks to effectively taint a batch of another chem.

They have quite a tolerance, and if they go up to about 100mg of 2map237, it will fade them for a solid 45 minutes and they tell me it feels great.  I just don't know about the AP238 crap... It's not as potent to my rats, it's also feels MUCH more caustic than 237, gives me them aches in the gut which I attribute to gas (but could be totally wrong here) and AP238, at least my batches anyway numb the fuck out of my rats mouth, VERY similiar to Lidocaine or if I licked the line up card from a nice batch of Ye-yo...  \n\nHave Etazene on the way, my rats need something with a bit more kick to it than both 2MAP237 and AP238.  I'm praying Etazene feel \"healthier\" than both these chems, but if I had to choose one over the other, 2MAP237 all day long!  It hits my receptors so much harder than AP 238 remotely tries too.  \n\nAlso, my rats noticed that AP 238 comes on similar to suboxone?  Agonist and Antagonist?  I know the first time they withdrew off 2MAP237, they said it fucking sucked.  It was very edgy, very shakey, very anxious type of WD.  AP 238 WD sucked in it's own way, similar to suboxone, where it was there, rats were pissy all god damned day, but could play it off and with the use of Kratom that could knock 80-90% of it out.  With 2MAP237, Kratom killed roughly 30-50% of the WD for the first 3 days, then it gets better day by day.  Just my rats 2 cents on these chems.  Both will not be used long term for me.  So far, my rats have gone through 25g of 2MAP237 and 15g of AP 238.  My rats are signaling to me, enough of this please, go find us something else, healthier please!",

Buprenorphine will displace any opioids at the mu-receptor which have a lower affinity than buprenorphine itself has at that receptor, and currently, that list includes almost every opioid out there, both natural and synthetic opioids alike. That even includes naloxone (this is why the buprenorphine/naloxone combination makes zero sense, because buprenorphine out-competes naloxone for the receptor).\n\nI don't know what the binding affinities for this molecule are so it's *possible* that it has a super, mega-high affinity for the opioid receptor that out-competes buprenorphine, but from looking at its chemical structure, I would say this is extremely unlikely to be the case. If you are opioid-dependent and you take buprenorphine *after* taking an active dose of AP-238, you are 95+% likely to find yourself in a state of precipitated withdrawal in my estimation. If you already have buprenorphine in your system and you take this, then you will just experience either reduced or negated effects from the AP-238, but you won't go into precipitated withdrawal. It's when buprenorphine is introduced *after* the presence of other opioids that it can precipitate withdrawal for a few hours until it begins to fully exert its own agonist effects at the receptors.\n\nI genuinely don't intend this as in insult but more of a warning - if your understanding of pharmacology and these chemicals you're experimenting with is so poor that you thought \"synthetic opioids cannot be displaced by buprenorphine\", and you can't even wrap your head around buprenorphine's interaction with other opioids at its primary receptor target, then you really are the last kind of person that needs to be dabbling with this stuff. None of us are immune to unforeseen harm caused by testing these compounds on ourselves, but there is a minimum level of pharmacological understanding that you should have going into it, especially if you're wanting to combine it with something else and try to predict the outcome. Please be careful. I'm less concerned about buprenorphine's interaction with AP-238 and more concerned about other things you experiment with and combine. Stay away from benzodiazepines and alcohol while you are experimenting with AP-238 or similar opioids unless you are physically dependent upon benzodiazepines, in which case you need to take a minimal amount to avoid the potential for seizures.",

I’d put it closer to oxycodone IF I had to but definitely not OxyContin. As for bupe or subutex (or Suboxone which is bupe + naloxone) I understand what it is and probably have more experience with both meds and/or was on it a lot longer than OP ....which is why I decided to respond to this post. If OP can’t feel his meds anymore than it means he’s probably been on a stable consistent dose for a while, if he’s not at the highest or peak level subutex/suboxone (which I think may be 32mgs but not sure) , then he can still achieve euphoria from the medication by increasing his dose or usually intranasal if he’s on subutex (as I mentioned above) and I still feel as though he’d receive just as much or maybe even more euphoria and not have to deal with the laundry list of side effects that comes with jumping of MAT meds and snorting a compound comparable to paint thinner or battery acid ( and lets not even get into the liver effects rn). Also by avoiding 238, which may be most important OP, he wouldn’t have to deal with the quasi guilt of relapsing or take the risk of stopping his MAT meds to get a taste of that garbage 238 high only to ultimately end up saying “fuck it” then go pick up a real opiate like H (which I assume he’s already done or gotten close enough to if he’s on subs). In conclusion, I think you sound like you’ve never experienced bupe or suboxone/subutex and like I mentioned in my initial response OP should “turn back now” while he has the chance because in the end if you’re willing to stop your MAT meds to chase a full opiates antagonist high (or relapse)....you might as well get something that’s going to be worth (ie the real deal) and something with a ton less side effects.",

It's a strange opioid, in my opinion. It feels almost like a partial agonist (others have said this too), but won't cause precipitated withdrawals like buprenorphine does. I think it's just because it isn't a competitive antagonist like buprenorphine is, but just a partial agonist maybe. It didn't seem to cause strong withdrawals when I stopped it. I'm not too sure how I feel about it. The first and second day with it was great, but then it just sort of loses its effect somewhat quickly.",

        "body": "First of all, 6mg/ml means each spray is about 125 micrograms, so you'd get 750 micrograms per spray.  So it's definitely weak enough - and annoyingly weak for anyone with a fent level tolerance. I think I know the place your getting it from.  I find them INSANELY overpriced and slow as shit with their shipping.  I'm guessing this is the place that had an employee scam people out of money before he quit, and their website talks about how that email wasn't theirs so they weren't responsible for anyone who lost money, etc, etc, etc.  Bur fucking $90 for 60mg?!?!?!  Thars equivalent to $1,500/g!!!!!  At least they offer a g of the pure powder for only an insane $520/g.  So you could order that instead of the sprayer and cut the rate per g by 67%.  Even if your totally opiate naive and only use 1mg per dose  - u will take 1mg every 1-2hrs.  So after waiting 2-3 weeks to get it you'll be out in 2-4  days tops if you get the 60mg sprayer.  It has insanely short legs.  If your opiate dependent get ready to wake up every 2hrs to dose.  Personally, I used like 5-15mg per dose and I know people with higher tolerances.  And I'm talking about the pure stuff.  Personally I'd try to get the powder over the liquid solution. I think my vendor just sent me a sample of the 1:2 mix along with my order of the pure. Pure was grey this time and what I think is the mix is tan.  I'm waiting to hear from him that it is in fact the 1:2 mix before I use much of it -  since I get drug tested every few weeks and don't wanna risk taking something I'm not assured won't make me fail a piss test.  I did take a 2-3mg tiny sniff of it, and it honestly felt close to what 3mg of the pure felt like.  For some reason my vendor does much better pricing on the 1:2 mix than the pure - even adjusting for the ratio. So my next order may be for the mix.  I avoided it at first b/c I didn't wanna take a ton of caffeine all day and night and fear that it was more diluted than the advertised 1:2 ratio.  But now I think it's by far the best bang for the buck.  \n\nOverall, it's a pretty good opiate.  Compared to some RC opiates that were awful for me - like 2F-viminol and ap-238.  It's also better than ones that worked but weren't awesome, like 2-Methyl-ap237.  Probably the only drawback are its legs.  At 2hrs, it's just not a feasible long term solution for those dependent.  It would be like having a newborn baby b/c you can't sleep for more than 2hrs at a time.  But for dabbles it's a pretty good opiate.  Fun times and no risk of failing a drug test, even same day you use it.  I would get the powder myself at the lowest rate you can.  Then spend $20 on a good scale accurate to 1mg and do the volumetric dosing yourself so you can  make your saline solution only like 100 micrograms per spray since you have zero tolerance.  You can make it weaker than the spray they are selling AND get it for waaaaay cheaper than the premade sprayer.  It's super easy to do on your own.  If you get a 15ml sprayer, just take the # of mg you use and divide by 120 (# of sprays in a 15ml sprayer) and you'll get your dose per spray.   So if you put 12mg in a 15ml sprayer, you'd be at your 100 micrograms per spray.",

IV and nasal both carry significant risks with these two if you are prone to redosing (short duration means come to expect that -- especially with those ROAs!). If not, I would recommend Oral in a Cap dosing to begin with and for regular usage. Save the IV and insufflation for every now and again, imo.\n\nFrom what I've read about U77 (was before my time), nothing in the RC scene really touched its rush and euphoria. I could be wrong on that but that's the way it comes across to me. \n\nLike already mentioned, Etazene and Meto are probably more suitable from your description and definitely don't seem as acidic as 237/238. \n\nAnyways, hope you find what you're looking for!

I ran through 5g of 2MAP in about 8 days, yes I have a tolly, but god damn. I'm also a decent Kratom user as well taking roughly 20-30 grams daily when I know I dont' have any opi's on hand.  I got my first batch direct from China and the causticity didnt seem too bad.  90% of the batch I inhaled nasally, then ran either a netipot or some of that saline spray towards the end of the day to help clear.  In the mornings, I blow CHUNKS of mucous or whatever that shit was, but never any blood.  I also vaped this substance until it start having lung pain in both the front of my chest and in my back, so obviously, I quit vaping the substance.  It's such a great fucking high, short lived, but the rush, fuck me....\n\nAbout tolly issues, my first dose was 40 mg of what appeared to look like table salt, just a touch larger in size.  I'd take a credit card and turn that into powder and pew pew up the nostril hole it went.  5g gone in no time.  By the end, I have no idea what my dosages were, I would pour some out and rail a 6 to 8 inch line to get me close to where my first 40mg dose got me (which rocked me pretty hard at first.  I thought I FINALLY found the RC Opi that i had been looking for with it similar oxycodone feel to it, just slightly more edgy.  \n\nI just received a small sample of AP 238 yesterday and to those saying 238 is less caustic MUST have a different batch than I do.  I tried vaping, snorting, plugging, and gel capping yesterday with the only effective way being gel cap.  Everything else was FAR TOO CAUSTIC!  People, be careful with this one.  Stick to O-DSMT if your tolly is low, or buy some Etazene if tolly is high.  Those two \"seem\" to be the safest and most legit of all RC Opi's right now.  \n\nAlso, after consuming the 5 grams of 2MAP237, I obviously had some WD to go through.  I spent 4 days getting through the worst of it, but it wasn't really anything Kratom couldn't and 50mg of Codeine Phos coudln't handle.  Within one days use of AP 238, i woke up this morning at 3am in withdrawal.  I went and loaded 60mg in a gel cap, swallowed and went back to bed.  \n\nBe careful with the two substances guys.  I have 10 more grams of 2MAP 237 coming.  Not sure what I'm going to do with it.  Prolly keep it for those \"rainy\" days, but either of these are not an everyday chem.  I beleive we have have enough reports out now to prove these chems will kill you eventually from the inside out.  Play safe guys, if you do indulge in either of these chems, keep it to 1-2 days at most and put the shit down.",

There are a lot of different posts about them, and lots of different information, and you really should look through as many of them as you can to get a well rounded picture of the current state of the research. A quick concise summary is:\n\n2map: very short effect duration (1 hour tops for euphoria for oral, 15 minutes nasal, a few hours after of pain relief for oral, 1 hour nasal) but decent rush, very caustic in all roa's with snorting being painful, oral causing stomach issues for some. General consensus is for harm reduction put it in a gel cap so that it doesn't get on any tissue on the way to your stomach where it can be dissolved/processed. pretty strong and dose depends on opioid tolerance: start with an allergy test (1 mg) and then 10 mg, adjust up from there. tolerance will rise very quickly with repeated dosing and doses reported are in a very very wide range. \n\n238: different reports on this, and not as many as 2map. current general consensus is 1.5x the potency of 2map, causticity is split with some people saying just as caustic, others saying not at all. effects are a more gradual come up than 2map (less rush), and last a couple hours longer. pretty much like 2map but less rush, longer duration and a more stable high. \n\nThese compounds are legal for laboratory and research purposes. Surely this is why you're asking and what you intend, as if intended for human consumption, then they are not legal. Exception is the UK where they aren't legal at all (believe this is due to the Psychoactive Substances Act which makes basically any drug/research chemical illegal under a blanket ban).",

In the absence of any projection, you’re free to realize who you really are.\n\n- The guru is an archetype or energy, not an individual person. Be careful about projecting this archetype onto a fallible human being, it’s a set-up for disillusionment and exploitation.\n\n- The true teacher doesn’t take himself to be a guru but points instead to the true guru inside you.\n\n- The true teacher is aware of the tendency among seekers to idealize their teachers and project their own assumptions and expectations upon them. Knowing this, the teacher doesn’t (mis)use these projections for their own personal gain and aggrandizement.\n\n- The teacher realizes that “enlightened person” is an oxymoron and does not take possession of this identity. In the presence of enlightenment, the ego is absent—that’s why it’s called enlightenment.\n\n- The teacher is merely the finger pointing at the radiant moon of your true nature. Once you’ve glimpsed the moon, you needn’t focus on the finger.\n\n- The realization “I am That” reveals that there is only That, not that there is only me. The first is called awakening; the second is called narcissism.\n\n- The teacher has a responsibility to be impeccable in their dealings with students, because they represent a world of meaning that the student reveres and aspires to understand.",

        "body": "*This will be a long ass and poorly formated response so forgive me ahead of time... Trying to be descriptive when I'm quite bad at describing shit like a drugs effects...*\n\n So far I've only tested 238 a couple times in sub ~60mg doses, so more research is needed... But as is in terms of best bang for your buck and best high/analgesia of the several RC opi ive used. **Also should be noted that I have a moderate tolerance, nothing crazy like a fentalog habit level tolly, but definitely high above baseline. Also have used basically all different ROA's, tho no needles were used in the research of any of these Chems. Here's a top 3 of the ones I've tried (which isn't many)\n\n[#1 = O-DSMT] - It's Not the MOST euphoric but it does have a Very long duration, very warm & cozy euphoric glow to it. Also very versatile for nearly anything you could possibly want and opioid to do effect wise. The dose range('therapeutic index' so to speak) Is also very wide ranged. Its one you can take in first thing in the AM and still function and work and go about your day as normal. Its minimally sedating at first which and progressively but slowly becomes heavier and more sedating/warm/nod inducing after the peak. Best ROA is definitely plugged, faster onset compared to orally but it still takes a good half hour to start to peak when plugged.\n\n[#2 = 2-M-AP237] - (Putting this above ap238 for the time being simply because I've not had a ton of Exp. With ap238 as stated) Anyways, this one for me was very euphoric. I was actually surprised by this one at first. Very rapid onset, even orally on an empty/near empty stomach I'd be feeling it HARD in under 15min. Its also very short acting and doesn't last longer than 2hr if you're lucky. Very warm and fuzzy, has a nice rush snorted and plugged. However there's a major issue with this one... It's quite caustic, I've had several batches all of which were quite caustic... some were slightly less harsh than others, but at the end of the day this issue definitely isn't batch dependent... its either (most likely) the chemical itself just being 'naturally' caustic or something involved in the synth process that causes it. Either way this can obviously cause issues with repeated use. IMO the best overall ROA for this was intranasally, hits instantly with a nice rush. though due to the caustic nature I'd recommend not snorting this Chem, burns pretty bad. I've definitely snorted worse but this stuff is pretty bad. I also found oral use on an empty stomach to be nearly identical effect wise to snorting it but with less rush. Preferred ROA would be to chew a few Tums/antacids before dosing orally as this seems to sort of neutralize some of the acidity IME.\n\n[#3 = Ap238] Heads up this one I'll compare directly to 237 as it's Very similar overall to the 237. Has less of a full on rush that  237 and takes a little longer to hit, but it does stick smack hard af. This one feels more heavy and sedating than 237 to me. Lasts longer than 237, I'd say about an extra hour or so. Hard to say exactly but seems about 1.5-2x the potency of 237. Definitely not the 4-5x as early reports/research/literature first suggested. A good bit Less caustic, MUCH easier on the nose initially, however due to the major difference in consistency and texture (237 being hard, rocky, crunchy crystals and the 238 being basically the opposite... more of a fluffy, clumpy flour texture) this one clogs up the sinuses more than 237 but doesn't burn or sting nearly as much.\n\n\nOthers I've tried; 2F-Viminol (cyclodextrin chelated/coated), brorphine, & piperidylthiambutene. ++++ The 2f-vim in its commonly available form is quite weak due to the the cyclodextrin 'coating'. This stuff was nearly impossible to chop up a line, it just clumps and sticks to itself rather than breaking down to dust. Oral was best on this one but it still sucked and requires a low tolerance or massive doses all for a Lackluster opi buzz.++++ The brorphine is very potent, depending on who you ask or what article you read some say 8-11x morphine, others say up to 12-15x morphine. Very sedating and heavy, very little if any euphoria, it is long lasting and does give a little bit of that warm glow but other than that this ones only good for someone opioid tolerant needing extra pain relief or as a maintenance. Tried snorted/oral/vaped/smoked. All of which were shit. This one ain't worth buying IMO. Plus it's the most dangerous one in terms of OD risk on this list. Its also practically insoluble In any common solvent, tried PG/VG/Ethanol and mixtures of all 3. It would never dissolve, shaking like crazy, hot water baths, even got frustrated and microwaved the shit on high multiple times and it still didn't dissolve. So safely volumetric dosing is essentially out the question.++++The piper I ain't even worth talking about. This ones most likely literally toxic. It looks like dirt, smells extremely strong of some sort of solvent or precursors/byproducts of the synthesis. Woukd turn urine DARK brown/reddish color for 12-24hr post dose at any dose or ROA. If that wasn't bad enough it also felt pretty much inactive at any dose I tried it seemed to do absolutely nothing at all... Stay away...\n\nAnyways that's that lol... I tried to be descriptive rather than just make a list and not explain why I ranked them.as I did. The latter 3 aren't worth buying at all IMO. Do with this info as you wish, and be safe 😤",

Some describe it as the crack of opioids. Its potency is quite high (use the search function to find recommendations for dosage)**\n\n\n**- Metonitazene has a significantly longer duration, but it isn't as euphoric as Etazene and will have you nodding with some euphoria. It is quite potent as well, but be very careful because it has a steep curve when it comes to dosage.**\n\n**- Fluonitazene is quite useless. Inferior in every way. I wouldn't advice anyone to consider this one.**\n\nWhen it comes to the Withdrawals and such, the reports vary very widely! Some report that these compounds are able to punch through substances such as Subuxone or Methadone and the withdrawal us awful, while others only experienced mild WD symptoms. Keep in mind that the data is sourced from a very small pool of people because not that many reports exist.\n\nO-DSMT is a very safe bet for a semi-euphoric opioid with a sufficiently long duration and lots of research behind it. But unfortunately it won't be around for long, since it is starting to be marketed as a prescription drug soon and most labs will stop synthesis right away in fear of a lawsuit. And of course it isn't as cost effective as say Metonitazene, but the only safe way to administer Metonitazene and Etazezne is in a volumetric solution, nasally via spray or via the mouth. \n\nAP-238 is another one to consider as it isn't as dangerously potent as Etazene and Metonitazene, but more so than O-DSMT. It is also more euphoric than O-DSMT, but unfortunately the duration us only slightly longer than MAP-237 and it is just as caustic.\n\n**The bottom line is that there is currently no opioid RC that \"has it all\". All of them have their drawbacks.**",

All of the harms of fentanyl can be mitigited with proper saftey procedures. Anyone remeber AH-7921? How about MT-45? These chemicals are so far away from any known opiod that the saftey profile cannot accuratly be predicited. The chemical itself could be toxic or cause seizures. Users of these two substances reported some very concering side effects such as hearing problems and hair loss. As well as dysporia, cauaticisty and hallucinations. Most likely due to kappa antagoism but the binding profile remains complely unknown. Now we have 2map and ap-238 which are an improvment on mt-45 for sure and they have seen clinical use. But for anyone who is tolerant / dependant these chems are of little use. The dose required is in the 100s of miligrams and for the price its just not economical. They serve ok for the opiod naive but even then O-DSMT is far superior. Its saftey profile is well established and potency is on par with morphine. I know that it is likely going to be gone from the market soon and 2map and friends are a reasonable replacement for the opiod naive market. Its unfouratant that the options are either insanly potent such as fentanyl and the nitazene compounds. Despite the extreme potency these compounds lack the euphoria that heroin, oxy, and others have. The short duration and heavy sedation are undesiriable as well. Then on the other side we have compounds like 2map, ap238 and odsmt that are generally good compounds for the opiod naive. They are essentially useless for the fentalog consumers and fentalogs are far too risky for the naive. So until the market gives us a compound that works for both of these groups eg oxycodone fentalouges and etonitaze based compounds will continue to be the best option for depentant users. The closest we ever got to this was u47700. The potency was not to weak and not to strong. The duration and causticy were drawbavks but overall this was the best compound to hit the market",

It was intirely the vendors idea to name it as such. Maybe because just posting the IUPAC wouldn't really give answers to many people not familiar with chemistry.\n\nFrom that paper you can see that there was a even more promising compound, and later more compounds with more promise have been theorized. They often go with the easiest one though :/",

I was on 238 my first 3 days of detox - it SUCKED for me.  238 did NOT seem to keep up very well with my bodies opiate needs, it seemed like only a partial agonist, since the more I took, the worse I began to feel.  I used 10-50mg doses of 238 orally and nasally and I did not get much benefit.  I even took up to 150mg within 2hrs and didn't get better. Never got to puking stage, so it did do SOMETHING for my opiate dependence, since normally I'd be puking by day 2 latest.  But it was so useless I switched to poor man's methadone and took like 25mg of imodium a few times a day for 1-2 days and felt MUCH better than the 238 had me feeling.  But I also had a gram of 237 to try, I just started with the 238 b/c its supposed to be stronger.   After trying 30mg of 237 orally i felt MUCH better than i had the first 4 days, and have been using doses of 20-60mg of 237 orally for 3 or so days now.  I do feel like it has very short legs.  While I awake I feel the need to redose every 2-3hrs MAX.  If I'm asleep I'll usually wake up 4-6hrs from my last dose and be in cold sweats, shakes and nausea.  Really I've been dosing every 2hrs, but am running low unfortunately and not getting piss tested until wed.  In any case, I piss tested myself last night and passed a 5 panel with general opiates on it, an oxy onlu test, and a fent only test.  All passed while actively dosing all day and several days prior in a row.  You can feel safe it won't cause any false positive.  It definitely doesn't have the metabolite of norfentanyl or any morphine like metabolite that they look for in piss tests.",

You noted one acute event with odsmt, how long have you been taking opioids in high doses, and at a frequency more than a couple times per week?\n\nTapers can be done at any rate, but generally the faster the taper the more intense the side effects will be. When you say 50 mg ap-238 every 3 hours how many times does that mean during the day? One idea is to reduce all your doses by 10% each week. So week 1 you take 45 mg per dose, week 2 40 mg per dose, etc until you're down to a very low amount. You seem to really need to jump off so you may want to consider a more rapid taper of 50% per week. Once you get down to a very low amount such as 5-10 mg then you could reduce your dose frequency.\n\nFor helper medications it really depends on what you're withdrawing from, the duration of use, the intensity of the drug. Something like AP-238 is very unknown as of now, but a lot of reports are suggesting it may be a partial agonist. If that is the case that's great news for you, because that will be a lot easier to jump off from.\n\nOnce you taper down low you can replace it with Kratom and Loperamide (or use loperamide in general as you decrease your doses if you get side effects). The Kratom will help keep your mood up/fewer overall withdrawl side effects, and the Loperamide will stop you from having extreme GI distress/shitting constantly. Depending on your answer to habit duration etc, Kratom and Loperamide are going to be a better option than something like Suboxone which you could get hooked on just as easily. Not to say that Kratom and Loperamide use chronic isn't a problem, but it's much less severe than opioid rc's.\n\nWishing you the best, if you have other questions or that helped a bit let me know.",

Sometimes I still distrust the potency in humans when in vitro tests show something is ridiculously potent, in example I would never do with my current tolerance more than 50 mcg of etonitazene and probably wouldn’t do it at all.

I used that chemical for about 5 months, only doing a gram a week every 2 weeks or so.

But actually I liked the burning sensation of 237 in contrast to 238 which is just unpleasant but for a short moment only tho. Oh dam, i forgot about that nasty stuff piperidylthiambuthene of which i'd definitely say that it is poisonous to the body which id acquire from the color of my urine after taking it, which was the bloodiest looking fluid ive ever pissed out. Some said this may be caused from the metabolites that looked kinda red/brown because that stuff looked red/brown too. But the pain and acute immune reaction which occured when insufflated would lead me to the conclusion that this stuff was indeed poisonous. Would even say it was 10 times worse than any buccinazine analoge when taken nasally. You werent even able to snort a lot as your nose would clog up instantly and started to swell so there wasn't any possibility to get more of any stuff in there. Of non rc's id say meth comes pretty close in the sense of acute stabbing pain when insufflated. \n\nSorry for the long answer and the possible grammar errors not my native language but I think some can understand.",

        "body": " Hi there,\n\njust signed up to report back my experience with this novel RC opioid. A little background info regarding tolerance: I'm a daily Kratom user (\\~20gpd, almost 1 year) and have quite a high natural tolerance to opioids. For example, when I’m not on Kratom and have no tolerance, I still need at least about 30-40 mg of Oxycodon for a decent high. Recently I consumed 2-methyl-ap-237 (2-map) about every 2-3 Weeks, always between 1-2 g for a couple of days. My usual dosage with 2-map is about 120 mg rectally, +-40 mg, depending on the effect I wish to achieve.\n\nSo I figured, after doing an allergy test,  that 50 mg plugged should be a reasonable starting dose (**for me!**). I redosed 25 mg 30 Minutes in, so all in all I took 75 mg via my golden hole ;). I try to compare the effects I got with 2-map effects. The powder dissolved easily in 2ml water, which then turned milky – cloudy. Feels way softer (less caustic?) in the butt after injection.\n\nThe comeup was a little bit slower for me, kind of a more steady, gradual comeup, less of a rush. Definitely less sedating and more stimulating overall. Regarding Euphoria, 2-map feels more euphoric than ap-238 by first impression. I was a little bit underwhelmed of the strength of the high. I would say its definitely more functional l and I don’t agree, that it has more of a high than 2-map.\n\nI can’t really say something about the duration of effects (because of adding 2-methyl-ap-237 about 5 hours later), but it seems to be in the same range as 2-map. With 2-map, I feel the “rush euphoric high” for roundabout 30-60 minutes and after that I have a stoning opiate buzz for several hours. Ap-238 - just like the comeup – seems to be more gradual, more balanced in it’s “time /// strength of effect – curve. Therefor the craving and urge to redose seems to be much less pronounced with this new compound. \n\nAfter the second dose I felt kinda “off” for like 10-20 minutes and my body felt – hard to describe – somehow edgy – not in a pleasurable way. This feeling faded after a while and left me with the described - relatively week - opiate buzz.\n\nAll in all, I’m quite disappointed and underwhelmed. Bear in mind that this experience is highly subjective and only based on one trial, I’ll report back, if further experiments change my estimation of this substance. \n\nSo far I would stick to 2-map in the future. I can’t really say something about potency after one (underwhelming) trial, but for me, 150 mg 2-map feels waaaaaay stronger than this 75 mg ap-238 experience (both plugged). **Maybe plugging just doesn’t work as well with ap-238, is this possible?** Strangely i had almost no miosis and no itchiness (which is a cons for me, i love itching on opiates).\n\nCheers,\n\nS0uljack3er",

For me, it totally destroyed my life, even if I was sticking with micro-dosing. It was not even a recreational drugs. A vey little euphoria, a very deep sedation, and I passed out countless of time.\n\nStopped and started again  5 times using, it, every time WD was worst and worst. I felt my body poisoned, same as my soul. The physical WD is not so terrible, you can taper with other 20-25x opioid potency, or with a massive dosage of subutex at the beginning.\n\nBut the psychological WD was the true hell. I never had in 30y of drugs usage panic attack and anxiety. Even after months I was clean from it, I still had those terrible conditions and I thought I'll never get back my life.\n\nBenzos or stims are not helping at all to cover those symptoms.\n\nLuckily is gone now. And, to make you a short recap of what is not around and avoid scams:\n\n\\- Isotonitazene doesn't exist anymore. Any seller claiming to have it, especially from china, is telling bs. You wil  get another Eto analogue.\n\n\\- Metonitazene: soon will be around. Analgestic potency will be 40-52x, bur euphoriant potency is pretty poor. So you will fuck your tolerance to have only a moderare recreational effect. It's less dangerous because it acts partially on dopamine receptors. A rough estimation of reports I had to far, for ppl with average tolerance, 2-5mg are approx 60-80mg oxycodone, but don't expect the same cool effect.\n\n\\- Etazene: lot of chinese seller are selling Etazene. Well, it's a lie as well. There is not Etazene shipping from china YET. it's probably some junk U-analogue cut with microdosages of Isotonitazene leftover. Etazene is anyway the most safe and closer to fenta anlogues (20-25x), smooth taste and works nicely smoked on glass pipe.People complains about Etazene because a) the batches around , and are only in Europe atm, are not consistent with potency b) it has very short legs (< 1h)\n\n\\- Fluonitazene: Available as well, Wikipedia says it's 25-40x but it's a wrong intel. This was on mices. Based on Etonitazene old research papers (1933), the question is still open. It could be a total trash, just 1/16 morphine potency, or could e a decent 7-12x potency analogue. Don't expect something amazing here as well. Only Etazene an Metonitazene share the similar structure or original compound, Etonitazene, and they are probably the best bet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill, I Just hope for a blanked ban of all those analogues. They are PLENTY of amazing RCs not based on morphine that chinese could synth, with a low analgesic potency (<10x) but with an euphoric kick and body warm better than oxymorphone and even than some middle potency fenta analogues.\n\nBut they don't give a shit, they do the stuff that are cheap and with high analgesic potency to make happy all USA fenta junkies.\n\nOnly thing could be potentially decent is AP-238, 2-4x morphine potency, but so far got no reports.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStay safe.",

After the addicted  finished the therapy, they were not interested at all in heroin anymore, they seeked only Ketobemidone :D\n\nDo not mistake with O-AMKD, the analogue made from chinese, that the original plan was https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetoxyketobemidone but before the synth they got scared and made a drastic change.\nIt ended up to be a stimulant opioid but with no big recreational value. Unless you are going to use it to replace amphetamines, then it's definitely better, no side effects.\n\nPeople with low tolerance even say O-AMKD is giving some opi buzz. I didn't feel it. And there is a conspiracy saying O-AMKD is for real the compound I linked above.. idk, could be true or not, seems some labs results will speak the truth.\n\nKetobemidone is only 0.8x morphine potency, but effects are very close to oxymorphone, and taken IV is surpassing it. But it's produced only in 2 country of the world, i spent years hunting it for my pharmaceutical opioid museum.\n\nThere are a LOT LOT LOT more of other holy grails. Compounds < 5-8x morphine potency but with effects lot more euphoric than oxymorphone and some could even get close to fenta analogues warm body nod.\n\nThere are a lot of possibilities, morphine based RC or other opioid families. They are just sitting there and waiting. But the trendy is sadly only Etonitazene analogues, insanely potent analgesic-wise, but with very poor recreational effects, fucking up your tolerance for just a small enjoyable effect. I just hope there will be a blanket ban so chinese will finally start focusing on those other compounds.\n\nIt's not super hard to make, neither too easy. And precursors are somewhat expensive, even if not impossible to find. As I said, there are lot more interesting legal alternatives, but people in USA just want strong shit, and EU people are happy with the overpriced oxy and Heroin (that is overall a good quality).\n\nBut I am sure that very soon, with NL, UK and DE out of the games, bringing an euphoric and safe opioid, legal, on the RC opioid scene, would be a big score, since the best you can get in EU is o-dsmt or AP237. And O-DSMT idk how long will be still available, as I posted already few times, it's becoming an official pharmaceutical before the end of the year.\n\nThe best thing so far is Etazene, but it's overpriced and short acting.\n\nBrorphine is nothing special either (Etazene deff better). So yeah, we are stuck. If you want something good, I fear you need to make it by yourself, I don't see any interesting upcoming opioid on the market soon.\n\nAP-238 could be a thing (even if it's just a fake name, but at least the structure is legit).

Wheeler's claims are completely unfounded and not accepted in any circles I'm aware of, they're only popular really because of how wacky they are. Quantum mechanics is not ambiguous about how wave functions collapse. You must be familiar with uranium-238: the particles in the isotope do not have enough energy to escape, but since their velocity is well defined due to the uncertainty principle their position is not, and they occasionally find themselves outside of the atom leading to radioactive decay. We know this happens without human perception due to traces of that decay after the fact. This decay is precisely a wave function collapse, yet no human observer was present, how would this happen? How do these atoms decay when we're not looking?",

He even stopped smoking Cigarettes.\n\n5 years pass, he drinks occasionally and doesn't takes any illegal substances. It's been 6 months since he last had any drink, it's his friend's birthday, his friend insisted to stay, he had two 600ml beer and 60ml whiskey and went out to take his bike to drive back home. His friend asked him not to drive, didn't listen and repeated the exact same story about how good he is in driving still being under influence of alcohol.\n\nHe left his house, smoked a cigarette at a Gas Station shop, left from the shop at around midnight.\nPast 2 hrs, phone switched off and no one has any clue where he is and how he is as he told everyone at his home that he might stay at his friend's place and and his friend assumed he got home safe and since it's late and he's wasted, he might have forgotten to call.\nPast 4hr, his friend started panicking and eventually called his mother to know if he came home safely or not. At around 4:15 am, his family and his friends got to know, he has gone missing and everyone had seen him at the Gas station.\nAt around 5 am, Call came from an unknown number, it was milk delivery guy who found a person on the side of the Motorway severely injured with an crushed Orange KTM. He had numbers written on paper with names and after calling top 3 people, the 4th one was his secret girlfriend.\n\nShe contacted his mother about this and told her the address of the hospital.\n\nTurns out, after driving for 8 km, he blacked out but still managed to drive 10 km after that and then he had an accident, which he can't recall, the skin of his skull was torn, he broke 3 fingers and nipped 1 cm of his tip of the tongue. He says he remembered he smoked a cigarette, and started drinking and then woke up in a hospital with top of his head peeled like banana and had 238 stitches.\n\nDON'T DRIVE WHEN YOU'RE UNDER INFLUENCE OF DRUG OR ALCOHOL.\nEVER.",

Water acts as a catalyst and plays a key role in denaturing the proteins of vegetative cell membranes. 70% IPA solutions penetrate the cell wall more completely which permeates the entire cell, coagulates all proteins, and therefore the microorganism dies. Extra water content slows evaporation, therefore increasing surface contact time and enhancing effectiveness. Isopropyl alcohol concentrations over 91% coagulate proteins instantly. Consequently, a protective layer is created which protects other proteins from further coagulation.\n\n>Solutions > 91% IPA may kill some bacteria, but require longer contact times for disinfection, and enable spores to lie in a dormant state without being killed. A 50% isopropyl alcohol solution kills Staphylococcus Aureus in less than 10 seconds (pg. 238), yet a 90% solution with a contact time of over two hours is ineffective. Some disinfectants will kill spores with exposures times that exceed 3-12 hours, which are classified as chemical sterilants. So why do higher alcohol solutions yield fewer results for bactericidal and antimicrobial outcomes?\n\nhttps://blog.gotopac.com/2017/05/15/why-is-70-isopropyl-alcohol-ipa-a-better-disinfectant-than-99-isopropanol-and-what-is-ipa-used-for/",

It takes more effort and more time, but the end results are on a whole other level. This is NOT one of those “fast easy recipes”, this is for those who love to make shit like this.\n\nThis classic fudge recipe uses only 4 simple ingredients: Cream, Sugar, Chocolate and Vanilla. There is no butter in here at all, so we will have to add our THC by way of adding concentrates. You can adjust the amount of concentrates to suit your needs and you are free to use the cannabis extract of your choosing.\n\nI guarantee this will be the best fudge you will ever make if you follow the instructions! Don’t rush it, this is a labor of love that will love you right back! Experiment with the different terpene profiles from different strains to add their subtle flavor combination to your fudge!\n\n**TEMPERATURE IS KEY**\n\nThe key to any fudge is making sure the mixture achieves the proper temperature. For this recipe, you will need a candy thermometer to check the temps. If you do not have one, you can use the soft-ball method to check for proper consistency. \n\nI recommend a thermometer; this stuff can overheat pretty fast causing your fudge to become grainy. The soft ball stage you are looking for is 238 degrees F at sea level. You MUST adjust for altitude if you want the best results! \n\n**DOSEAGE**\n\nCannabis concentrates can contain anywhere from 40% - 95% THC – know what you are working with. Use this information when deciding the potency of each individual dose. For example, at 95% THC if you cut your fudge into 10 pieces, they will each contain approx. 95mg of THC. 20 pieces @ 46mg, 40 pieces @ 23mg, etc. \n\nCannabis Concentrate Infused Fudge\n\nThis recipe can easily be doubled!\n\n**INGREDIENTS**\n\n· 2 cups – white sugar\n\n· 1 cup – heavy cream\n\n· 4oz. – 85% – 99% cocoa (I prefer the Lindt 99% Cocoa EXCELLENCE Bar)\n\n· 2 tsp Vanilla Extract\n\n· 1gr. Cannabis Concentrate\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THE PROCESS**\n\n· Combine the sugar and cream in a heavy saucepan and whisk until well blended.\n\n· \\*\\*\\* Your saucepan should hold at least 4 times the volume of this mixture, it will rise to over triple its size during cooking!\n\n· Bring to a boil on medium-high heat stirring constantly until the mixture just begins to bubble. Once it starts to bubble, STOP STIRRING! Place the candy thermometer in the mixture avoiding contact with the pan.\n\n· Let this mixture continue to boil unstirred until it reaches soft ball stage (238F at Sea Level) and then immediately remove it from the heat. Let the mixture cool untouched until it reaches 130 degrees F.\n\n· While that is cooling, place the chocolate into a double boiler and place over medium-low heat – don’t let the water boil. Stir with a rubber spatula until melted and smooth. If you don’t have a double boiler, you can use a metal or glass bowl set on top of a small saucepan of water.\n\n· With the chocolate melted, add in the Cannabis Concentrate and stir well to incorporate. Ideally, you should hold this chocolate/cannabis blend at about 90-95 degrees while the sugar/cream mixture is cooling.\n\n· Once the cream/sugar has reached 130 degrees F, add the chocolate cannabis blend and the Vanilla extract. With a wooden spoon, start blending everything together.\n\n· Stir vigorously until the mixture becomes thick and dull, about 10 minutes of non-stop stirring. Stop before it becomes too stiff to stir. Alternatively, you could use a stand mixer on low with a paddle to do this; It takes 3-4 minutes.  Either way, the more you stir while it slowly cools, the smoother your fudge will be.\n\n· Line a 9×13 pan with wax paper or parchment paper. Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan, smooth out and let cool on the counter for at least 2 hours. Score the top of the fudge with a knife to mark your desired number of portions. Place in refrigerator until completely chilled and firm.\n\n· Once cooled, you can finish cutting your pieces, or simply snap them apart at the score lines. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Can be frozen for longer term storage.\n\nI’m definitely not going to say these are the healthiest of treats, but for the occasional desert or party favor, you just can’t go wrong with these! Makes great gifts too!",

        "body": "In regards to quantum mechanics, probability waves and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. These are our best current models of how the universe functions. There may be revisions in the future, there have been many adjustments and new ideas over the last century, but as far as we can tell they accurately represent many natural phenomena. They can seem unintuitive, but that's more likely a human congnitive bias given we evolved in the macro scale and our cerebral neural networks trained only on this scale, and not at the quantum. You specifically mentioned the uncertainty principle (the measuring of location of a particle). You seem to be implying this is simply a matter of observation, but it is not. It is our best understanding of how particles actually behave. It does not need to be measured to behave this way. Quantum systems completely devoid of human measurement or presence will still have probability waves and will have their location be more or less probable in certain locations simply due to them existing. For example uranium-238 has alpha particles within it which have a very well defined velocity, as in consistent, not well defined on paper, but in reality. But because it's velocity is well defined, it's position is subject to much higher probability, and so these alpha particles which do not have enough energy to escape the nucleus occasionally find themselves outside of it. If we considered the probability of quantum physics to simply be a limitation of science and observation, this uranium isotope would not be radioactive unless we were trying to observe it. Alas it is, and has always been, radioactive. This is not a limitation of science, it's an example of how powerful science is, that it has led us to an incredibly unintuitive perspective that nonetheless seems incredibly accurate. We have been able to use science to overcome the limitations of our own minds. It is an incredible process.\n\nRegarding the big bang, we don't know enough yet to know whether or not we can observe before it. But this isn't a failure of science, it's a (potentially temporary) failure of observation. If we could observe it, we'd be able to develop sound models for it. But not being able to observe does not imply unmodelable, it does not in any way support a conclusion that there exists any reality we cannot model and study given the right access to observe it. So far every mystery in human history which is no longer a mystery has fit squarely within the materialist scientific model. The only things that remain mysteries are those things that are unimaginably difficult to observe. To suspect that because they're difficult to observe makes them candidates for alternate \"mystical\" realities is incredibly fallacious. \n\nFollowing this same vein, psychedelic, entheogenic, mystical experiences should all be describable in scientific models of the brain. Why haven't they yet? It's incredibly difficult to observe human brain patterns in high resolution since opening it up stops the patterns in most cases. However with new neural lace technologies just about to start becoming mainstream and artificial intelligence giving us incredible insights, I have absolutely no doubt we will develop accurate models of all of these experiences including consciousness, psychosis, emotions, hallucinations, etc... As with everything else we've come to be able to observe, we'll come to understand it.",

I spoke with someone who could only get Accord which is why he had his Dr write for brand name and he said they felt the same as the Solco brand and he switched pharmacies and gets Solco now and it feels about the same as brand name \nI am still thinking about getting 60 2mg name brand. They are very pretty too with the K punches out of them\n\nThey used to be way cheaper, I’ve been on them 15 years and I remember going to the pharmacy and paying $97 without insurance for the brand name and the generic was $9.99 of Teva\nRoche discontinued them and there was so many complaints they brought them back but they are so much more expensive. I went in 2015 I went to Walmart with a script of 90 2mg which was normally $107 but it was like $320 so I just got generic \nI realizes that when ordering brand name is has to do with the quantity not mg\n120 0.5mg name brand would be more expensive than 60 2mg name brand \nActually I just looked 120 0.5mg brand name is $311-$320 depending where you go and 60 2mg name brand pills is $238-248\nWhich is still very expensive but I wish they were the normal prices they used to be before they discontinued them and boring them back\nI would usually get 120 1mg or 90 2mg a month and if I asked for brand it would be somewhere around $100 maybe a little more or a little less depending on the pharmacy \n\nAnyway the representative on the phone told me they would be back in the pharmacies by the end of summer or at least that’s what they are snorting for.  Not sure if the pill will look different as she said they had to re introduce them\nWhen I was 16 and started taking them the 1mg says 93/833 on one side and just a like on the back and the 2mg said 93/834 then they switched the press to where it said Teva on the front with a line one the back with those same numbers 832 for 0.5 and 833 for 1mg and 834 for 2mg.

I would suspect that you already have a pretty good idea what first plateau is like, even if you haven't dosed specifically for it before.  Most people tend to \"move through\" the lower plateaus on their way towards a higher one.  It's part of the comeup.  Also expect a strong desire to take more even if you don't have it, partly for that reason - your mind/body will be anticipating the stronger trip it's used to experiencing.  \n\nHowever, I wouldn't expect much of an afterglow if I were you.  Maybe you'll be fortunate and experience a light one, but for me, the afterglow is only easily noticeable after a 3rd plat or higher.  Everything about 1st plat is going to be a lot more subtle than what you're used to, so it's a good idea to intentionally look for or \"feel out\" those subtleties.\n\nI know I've seen your nym around here, so I'd be surprised if you didn't already know this, but... For dosing, [DexCalc](http://dexcalc.com/) is what you should be relying on (more than the advice of anonymous redditors).  At 195lbs, 180mg does put you well within the 1st plat range, but 238 mg is your recommended dose.",
