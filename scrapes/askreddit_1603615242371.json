I started doubting religion at around 12 or 13, and I felt guilty about it for years, even after I accepted that I was an atheist. I'd pray for forgiveness if I masturbated. I tried preaching to friends in an attempt to make myself believe it. Even now, I feel guilty that I don't believe my grandma is in heaven, because I don't believe in heaven. \n\nI think the most frustrating part is what I would consider gaslighting. For example, I mentioned me starting to struggle with faith at around 12 or 13. That was because my parents sent me up to the alter for a prayer from a visiting pastor who was praying over the kids for some reason. He went down the line, shoving each kid down. Literally pushing them to the ground. I saw him. And when he came to me, I felt him physically push me. I told my parents that I didn't appreciate it, and they insisted that I saw it wrong, and felt it wrong, and it was actually the holy spirit pushing on me. I knew what I saw, what I felt, and that was a grown man shoving children to the ground. There was a lot of stuff like that, my parents experiencing the exact same scenario and insisting it was God when there were perfectly non-supernatural explanations for it. I'm not sure if that technically counts as gaslighting, because I don't think they were trying to. I think they genuinely believed what they were saying, not that they were purposely trying to screw with my head.\n\nAlso, for the religious parents out there, PLEASE don't tell your young kids that demons exist. I was an easily frightened kid, and because I was told from infancy that demons are real, if I saw a scary movie or something, I believed it. It took me until I was 13 to be able to sleep without a nightlight because I genuinely believed demons and ghosts would kill me. Even kids shows with ghosts would get to me. It really screwed me up, for years. I've come to love the horror genre, but it took me until I was out of high school to be able to enjoy it because I was still pretty freaked out by it.",
